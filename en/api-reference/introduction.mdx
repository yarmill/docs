This documentation will provide you everything you need in order to get started, including code examples and information on authentication and error handling.

## Base URL
The base URL for the API is `https://ingest.ms.yarmill.com`.

## Authentication

All requests to the API must include an AppToken in the `Authorization` header. The AppToken can be obtained from Yarmill support.

<Warning>
  Your Yarmill AppToken should never be used client side or exposed to your end users.
</Warning>

```shellscript
Authorization: AppToken application_token_for_yarmill_access
```

## Content Type

All request and response bodies are in JSON format. Ensure that the `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Common status codes include:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized`: The request requires user authentication.
- `403 Forbidden`: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
