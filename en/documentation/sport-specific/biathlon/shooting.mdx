Use the `Shooting` field in Yarmill to record details from training or competition shooting — including intensity, miss count, timing, and miss positions.


<Note>
Yarmill automatically parses shooting entries into structured data for analysis. Make sure to follow the format and syntax below to ensure your entries are recognized correctly.

## Shooting Entry Syntax

### Parameters

<ParamField path="Intensity" required>
  Indicates the intensity level during which the shooting was performed.
  Always comes first in the entry and applies to all following lines until a new intensity is defined.

  Accepted values:
  - `i0` or `z0` for static shooting
  - intensity name (usually `i1-i5`)
  - `competition` or `race` for race shooting
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Position" required>
  Defines the shooting position.
  Must follow the intensity and applies to all following entries until a new position is specified.
  
  Accepted values:
  - `P` for prone
  - `S` for standing
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Missed shots" required>
  Represents the number of missed shots in a stage.
  You can enter multiple numbers in sequence (e.g. `0321`) to log several stages at once using batch entry.
  
  Accepted values:
  - integer `0-5`
  - `X+Y` for relay shooting, where `X` is the number of missed shots and `Y` is the number of spare rounds used

  Examples: `3`, `0+2`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="First shot time & Stage time">
  Optional timing data for each shooting stage.
  Represents the time of the first shot and the total time spent on the stage.
  
  Accepted values:
  - times in seconds, separated by `/` (first shot time / stage time)
  - `-` for a missing or unknown value
  
  Examples: 
  - `14/29` – first shot at 14s, total stage time 29s
  - `-/25` – first shot time unknown, stage time 25s
  - `13/-` – first shot at 13s, stage time unknown
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Miss positions and order">  
  Optional field that describes where missed shots went, using clock notation.
  You can also log the full shot sequence by entering all five shots and using `x` to mark hits.

  Accepted values:
  - clock numbers `1-12` to indicate miss positions
  - `'`, `` ` ``, or `,` as separators between values
  - `x` to indicate a hit when logging all five shots in order
  
  Examples:
  - `3' 11' 12'` – three misses at 3, 11 a 12 o'clock
  - `2 10` – two misses at 2 and 10 o'clock 
  - `4x5xx` – miss at 4, hit, miss at 5, hit, hit (first and third shot missed)
</ParamField>


## Examples 

```json title="Batch entry (no details) – v1"
i0       // static shooting
P 0320   // 4 static prone stages – 0, 3, 2, 0 misses
S 0210   // 4 static standing stages – 0, 2, 1, 0 misses
```

```json title="Batch entry (no details) – v2"
i1 P 0320   // prone shooting in i1 – 0, 3, 2, 0 misses
i2 S 0210   // standing shooting in i2 – 0, 2, 1, 0 misses
```

```json title="Detailed entry with miss positions"
i2              // shooting in i2 intensity
P 3 1' 3' 11'   // prone, 3 misses at 1, 3, and 11 o'clock
S 2 7' 10'      // standing, 2 misses at 7 and 10 o'clock
```

```json title="Detailed entry with times & miss positions"
i3              // shooting in i3 intensity
P 1 14/29 6     // prone, 1 miss, first shot at 14s, total stage time 29s, miss at 6 o'clock
P 2 -/26 12 6   // prone, 2 misses, total stage time 26s, misses at 12 and 6 o'clock
```

```json title="Detailed entry with order of missed shots"
competition       // race shooting
P 0 13/25         // prone, clean – first shot at 13s, total stage time 25s
P 1 12/26 x9xxx   // prone, 1 miss – second shot missed at 9 o'clock
S 0               // standing, clean
S 2 14/28 3xxx11  // standing, 2 misses – first shot missed at 3 o'clock, last at 11 o'clock
```

## Pro Tips

- **Be concise** – Use batch mode when you don’t need detailed info (like times or miss positions).
- **Double–check your entries** – Go to `Analytics / Shooting Analysis` and check the table at the bottom to make sure your entries were parsed correctly.
