Use the `Shooting` field in Yarmill to record details from training or competition shooting — including intensity, miss count, timing, and miss positions.


<Note>
Yarmill automatically parses shooting entries into structured data for analysis. Make sure to follow the format and syntax below to ensure your entries are recognized correctly.

## Shooting Entry Syntax

```text
{Intensity} 
{Position} 
{Missed shots} [1st shot time/Stage time] [Miss positions]
```

### Parameters

<ParamField path="Intensity" required>
  Indicates the intensity level during which the shooting was performed.
  Always comes first in the entry and applies to all following lines until a new intensity is defined.

  Accepted values:
  - `i0` or `z0` for static shooting
  - intensity name (usually `i1-i5`)
  - `competition` or `race` for race shooting
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Position" required>
  Defines the shooting position.
  Must follow the intensity and applies to all following entries until a new position is specified.
  
  Accepted values:
  - `P` for prone
  - `S` for standing
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Missed shots" required>
  Represents the number of missed shots in a stage.
  You can enter multiple numbers in sequence (e.g. `0321`) to log several stages at once using batch entry.
  
  Accepted values:
  - integer `0-5`
  - `X+Y` for relay shooting, where `X` is the number of missed shots and `Y` is the number of spare rounds used

  Examples: `3`, `0+2`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="First shot time & Stage time">
  Optional timing data for each shooting stage.
  Represents the time of the first shot and the total time spent on the stage.
  
  Accepted values:
  - times in seconds, separated by `/` (first shot time / stage time)
  - `-` for a missing or unknown value
  
  Examples: 
  - `14/29` – first shot at 14s, total stage time 29s
  - `-/25` – first shot time unknown, stage time 25s
  - `13/-` – first shot at 13s, stage time unknown
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Miss positions and order">  
  Optional field that describes where missed shots went, using clock notation.
  You can also log the full shot sequence by entering all five shots and using `x` to mark hits.

  Accepted values:
  - clock numbers `1-12` to indicate miss positions
  - `'`, `` ` ``, or `,` as separators between values
  - `x` to indicate a hit when logging all five shots in order
  
  Examples:
  - `3' 11' 12'` – three misses at 3, 11 a 12 o'clock
  - `2 10` – two misses at 2 and 10 o'clock 
  - `4x5xx` – miss at 4, hit, miss at 5, hit, hit (first and third shot missed)
</ParamField>


## Examples

```text title="Batch entry (no details)"
i1 P 0320     // 4 prone stages with 0, 3, 2, 0 misses
i1 S 0210     // 4 standing stages
```

```text
i1
P 1120
S 0010
```

```text Detailed entry with miss positions
i2
P 3 14/29 1 3 11     // 3 misses, logged by clock position
S 2 -/26 7' 10'
```

```text
competition
P 2 -/29 4x5xx       // ordered representation of shots: hit/miss pattern
S 1 14/28 xxxx11     // last two shots missed
```


## Pro Tips

- **Be concise** – Use batch mode when you don’t need detailed info (like times or miss positions).
- **Double–check your entries** – Go to `Analytics / Shooting Analysis` and check the table at the bottom to make sure your entries were parsed correctly.
